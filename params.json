Spice up your maps by adding customizable image filters to tile images.  Use one of the existing, free tile providers like MapQuest, OSM, Stamen, and others, then change up their default offerings by adjusting the colors/styling on the client end.\r\n\r\nThis plugin extends L.TileLayer based classes, adding support for tile image filters.  It provides extensible canvas-based filter approaches as well as CSS3 image filters.  Canvas filters can be chained together and combined with one or more CSS3 image filters, allowing for many variations.\r\nIt was originally inspired by [Ilya Zverev](https://github.com/Zverik)'s [Leaflet.TileLayer.Grayscale](https://github.com/Zverik/leaflet-grayscale/) plug-in, but modified to be more extensible, supporting more than just a grayscale tile filter.\r\n\r\n## Basic Usage\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar baseLayer = new L.TileLayer('http://otile1.mqcdn.com/tiles/1.0.0/map/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg', {\r\n\tfilter: function () {\r\n\t\tnew L.CSSFilter(this, {\r\n\t\t\tfilters: ['saturate(200%)']\r\n\t\t}).render();\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar baseLayer = new L.StamenTileLayer('toner');\r\n\r\nbaseLayer.setFilter(function () {\r\n\tnew L.CanvasFilter(this, {\r\n\t\tchannelFilter: function (imageData) {\r\n\t\t\treturn new L.CanvasChannelFilters.Colorize(imageData, {\r\n\t\t\t\tvalues: [100, 100]\r\n\t\t\t}).render();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}).render();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nhttp://humangeo.github.io/leaflet-tilefilter/demo.html\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nRead the [docs](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-tilefilter/wiki).\r\n","google":"UA-51577600-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
